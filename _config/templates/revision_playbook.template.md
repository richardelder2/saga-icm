## 2. Proposed Interventions & Author Options
*For every major critique point, the agent proposes 2-3 different ways to resolve it. The author selects their preferred option or writes in a custom solution.*

### Issue 1: [Name of Issue, e.g., Theme Explaining at Chapter End]
* **Option A (Cut):** Delete the narrator's explaining sentence entirely (Lines [X-Y]) and end the chapter on the character's silence.
* **Option B (Re-render as Action):** Replace the explaining sentence with a minor physical action that implies the shift (e.g., she closes the book and locks it in the desk).
* **Option C (Dialogue Option):** Shift the realization into dialogue with [Character Name] in the preceding scene.
* **Author Choice / Direction:** [Fill in choice: Option A, B, C, or custom note]

### Issue 2: [Name of Issue, e.g., Low Rhythm Variance / Flat Prose]
* **Option A (Vary Sentence Length):** Rewrite paragraph 4 to break up the uniform sentence lengths, converting long descriptive sentences into punchy fragments and combining others.
* **Option B (POV register shift):** Rewrite the paragraph in a closer, more immediate third-person stream of consciousness.
* **Author Choice / Direction:** [Fill in choice]

### Issue 3: [Name of Issue, e.g., Embodied Emotion Overload]
* **Option A (Rotate to Name of Feeling):** Replace "his heart hammered against his ribs" with "he was afraid."
* **Option B (Rotate to Behavioral Cue):** Replace the bodily reaction with a physical behavior (e.g., he reached into his pocket and squeezed the key).
* **Author Choice / Direction:** [Fill in choice]
